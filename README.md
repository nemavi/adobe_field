Description

The Adobe Field module adds a custom field type that allows users to preview Adobe Acrobat PDF files directly in a Drupal site using Adobe's embeddable iframe viewer. It supports up to 20 files and provides an improved file selection interface.

After adding an Adobe Field to a Drupal content type, the field's display can be configured under the "Manage Display" tab. This ensures that users can preview PDFs seamlessly within the Drupal environment.

Note:
Only publicly accessible files can be previewed, as Adobeâ€™s viewer requires access to the file URL. This means the module may not function correctly on local development environments or servers behind firewalls.
